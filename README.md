==================

This plugin uses the [ScalaPB](http://trueaccord.github.io/ScalaPB/) compiler to generate Scala case classes from protocol buffers and put them under the managed sources directory in your project.

Documentation: See [SBT Settings page](http://trueaccord.github.io/ScalaPB/sbt-settings.html).
